When running the app:-

-When selected cards are evaluated as wrong set, boarders should indicate by red color for example
-When selected cards are evaluated as true set, before dealing 3 more cards, user can still select more cards and score is updating ( app still evaluating )
-When dealing cards from the deck, cards are shuffled every time because updateView is called every time 3 more cards are added and affects all cards
